## API Boilerplate Code

# Key Components Explained

# Imports:
`express`: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and handling HTTP requests.
`@google-cloud/storage`: A library to interact with Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
`multer`: Middleware for handling file uploads.
`path`: A module for working with file and directory paths.
`fs`: The file system module to interact with the file system.

# Application Setup:
`const app = express();`: Initializes the Express application.
`const port` = process.env.PORT || 8080;: Sets the port for the server, defaulting to 8080 if not defined in the environment.

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Configuration:
`projectId and bucketName`: Store the GCP project ID and the name of the Cloud Storage bucket for uploaded media.

# Multer Configuration for File Uploads:
`upload`: Configures multer to save uploaded files to the uploads/ directory with a limit of 10 MB per file and restricts uploads to JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files.

# Directory Creation:
Checks if the uploads/ directory exists; if not, it creates it to store uploaded files.

# Media Processing and Detection Functions:
`preprocessMedia`: A placeholder function simulating media preprocessing (e.g., resizing, extracting frames).
`detectDeepfake`: A mock function that simulates deepfake detection and returns a probability score.

# Health Check Endpoint:
`GET /health`: A simple endpoint to check if the server is running correctly. It responds with { status: 'healthy' }.

# Deepfake Detection Endpoint:
`POST /detect`: This endpoint handles file uploads and performs the following:
Checks if a file was uploaded.
Preprocesses the media using preprocessMedia.
Uploads the processed file to Google Cloud Storage.
Simulates a deepfake detection using detectDeepfake.
Returns the original filename, GCS URL of the uploaded media, deepfake probability, and an explanation in the response.
Cleans up (deletes) the local file after processing to free up space.

# Starting the Server:
`app.listen(port, ...)`: Starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port, logging a message to the console.

# Test Locally
Run: `node index.js`
Test Health: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
Test Upload: `curl -X POST -F "media=@test.jpg" http://localhost:8080/detect`

## Summary
This code sets up a basic server that accepts media uploads, processes them, uploads them to Google Cloud Storage, and simulates a deepfake detection. The server also includes a health check endpoint to monitor its status. It can easily be expanded with real media processing and deepfake detection logic in place of the mocked functions.
