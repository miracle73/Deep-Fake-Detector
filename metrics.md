### 1. Define Metrics and Logging Requirements

**Objective**: Identify the key metrics and logs relevant to your deepfake detector app to ensure meaningful visualization.

- **Metrics**:

  - **Model Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, false positive/negative rates, inference latency, and confidence scores for deepfake detection.
  - **System Performance Metrics**: CPU/GPU utilization, memory usage, request throughput, error rates, and API response times.
  - **Custom Metrics**: Number of deepfake detections per minute, processing time per frame, or model confidence distribution.
  - **Alerting Metrics**: Thresholds for anomalies, such as sudden spikes in false positives or inference latency.

- **Logs**:

  - Application logs (e.g., detection events, errors, or warnings).
  - Model-specific logs (e.g., input data issues, preprocessing errors, or prediction failures).
  - Infrastructure logs (e.g., container or VM health, network issues).

- **Action**: Review your app's existing instrumentation. If not already implemented, use Google Cloud Monitoring's custom metrics and log-based metrics to capture these data points. For example:
  - Use the Google Cloud Monitoring API to send custom metrics from your app (e.g., `custom.googleapis.com/deepfake/detection_latency`).
  - Create log-based metrics in Google Cloud Logging for counters (e.g., number of detections) or distributions (e.g., latency histograms).

---

### 2. Set Up Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging

**Objective**: Configure Google Cloud to collect and store metrics and logs from your deepfake detector app.

- **Enable APIs**:

  - Ensure the **Cloud Monitoring API** and **Cloud Logging API** are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

- **Instrumentation**:

  - If your app runs on Google Cloud services (e.g., GKE, Cloud Run, or Compute Engine), use the **Google Cloud Operations Suite** to automatically collect infrastructure metrics.
  - For custom metrics, integrate the **OpenTelemetry SDK** or Google Cloud client libraries (e.g., Python's `google-cloud-monitoring`) into your app to send metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
  - For logs, configure your app to write structured logs to Google Cloud Logging using a logging library (e.g., `google-cloud-logging` for Python or `Bunyan` for Node.js).

- **Log-Based Metrics**:

  - Create **counter metrics** for events like successful detections or errors (e.g., `log-based-metrics/detection_count`).
  - Create **distribution metrics** for numerical values like inference latency or confidence scores. Use Google Cloud Logging's query language to extract relevant fields (e.g., `resource.type="gke_container" severity=ERROR` for error logs).[](https://lynn-kwong.medium.com/how-to-visualize-google-logs-in-grafana-54cb18efe454)

- **Authentication**:
  - Create a **Service Account** with the roles `roles/monitoring.viewer` and `roles/logging.viewer` (and `roles/monitoring.editor` if writing custom metrics).
  - Generate a JSON key for this service account and securely store it for Grafana integration.[](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/googlecloud-logging-datasource/)

---

### 3. Configure Grafana with Google Cloud Monitoring Data Source

  - **Infrastructure Dashboard**: Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU) and network metrics.
  - **Logs Dashboard**: Error logs, detection event logs, and log-based metrics visualizations.

- **Querying Metrics**:

  - Use the **Google Cloud Monitoring query editor** in Grafana to select metrics (e.g., `custom.googleapis.com/deepfake/detection_latency`).[](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/google-cloud-monitoring/query-editor/)
  - Apply filters (e.g., `instance_name = deepfake-app`) and aggregations (e.g., mean, sum, or percentile) to refine data.
  - For distribution metrics (e.g., latency), use **heatmap** or **histogram** visualizations to show trends.[](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/google-cloud-monitoring/query-editor/)

- **Querying Logs**:

  - Use the **Google Cloud Logging** data source to query logs with the Logging Query Language (e.g., `resource.type="gke_container" AND "deepfake detected"`).[](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/cloud-logging-data-source-plugin-for-grafana)
  - Visualize logs in **log panels** or create log-based metrics for numerical data (e.g., count of errors).[](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/googlecloud-logging-datasource/)

- **Visualization Types**:

  - **Time Series**: For metrics like detection rate or latency over time.
  - **Heatmaps**: For distribution metrics like inference latency or confidence scores.
  - **Stat Panels**: For single-value metrics like current error rate or total detections.
  - **Logs Panels**: For displaying raw logs or filtered error logs.
  - **Gauge/Pie Charts**: For system health metrics like CPU utilization or detection success/failure ratios.[](https://www.metricfire.com/blog/gcp-monitoring-with-graphite-and-grafana/)

- **Template Variables**:

  - Add variables for dynamic dashboards (e.g., select project, instance, or time range) to make dashboards reusable.[](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/google-cloud-monitoring/)

- **Sample Dashboard**:

  - Import prebuilt Google Cloud Monitoring dashboards from Grafana's dashboard library or GitHub (e.g., CPU utilization or storage metrics) and customize them for your app.[](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/enhancements-to-the-cloud-monitoring-grafana-plugin)[](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/06/30/new-in-the-google-cloud-monitoring-data-source-plugin-for-grafana-sample-dashboards-deep-linking-more/)

- **Action**: Start with a simple dashboard in Grafana Cloud's **Explore** view to test queries, then build full dashboards with panels for each metric type.

---

### 5. Set Up Alerts for Critical Metrics

**Objective**: Enable proactive monitoring by setting up alerts for anomalies or thresholds.

- **Google Cloud Monitoring Alerts**:

  - Define alerting policies in Google Cloud Monitoring for critical metrics (e.g., `detection_latency > 1s` or `error_rate > 5%`).
  - Use **Monitoring Query Language (MQL)** for advanced alerting logic.[](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/enhancements-to-the-cloud-monitoring-grafana-plugin)
  - Integrate with notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) for alerts.

- **Grafana Alerts**:

  - Create alerts in Grafana for metrics queried from Google Cloud Monitoring (e.g., latency spikes or low detection accuracy).
  - Note: Grafana Alerting is not directly supported for Google Cloud Logging queries, so use log-based metrics in Cloud Monitoring for alerting.[](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/googlecloud-logging-datasource/)
  - Configure notifications via Grafana's alerting system (e.g., email, Slack).[](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

- **Action**: Set up alerts for high-priority issues like model failures (e.g., confidence score < 0.5) or infrastructure issues (e.g., CPU > 80%).
